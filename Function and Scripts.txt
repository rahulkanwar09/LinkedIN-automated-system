1. authenticate(): This function handles the authentication process. It sends a POST request to the LinkedIn API token endpoint with the client credentials (client ID and client secret) to obtain an access token. The access token is then returned for further API requests.

2. get_new_connections(access_token): This function retrieves new connections of competitor decision-makers from LinkedIn. It takes the access token as a parameter and sends a GET request to the LinkedIn API to fetch the connections' details. The connections' data is returned as a JSON response.

3. generate_connection_request(connection): This function analyzes the profiles of new connections and generates a hyper-personalized connection request message. It takes a connection object as a parameter, which contains details such as the 'About Us' section, job description, and recent posts. You can modify this function to implement NLP techniques or other algorithms to analyze the connection's profile and generate a customized message.

4. send_connection_request(access_token, connections): This function sends connection requests to the new connections with personalized messages. It takes the access token and connections as parameters. For each connection, it generates a personalized message using the generate_connection_request() function and creates a payload with the recipient's details and the message content. It then sends a POST request to the LinkedIn API to send the connection request.

5. Main execution: In the main execution block, the code follows the sequence of steps to perform the automated system's functionality:

* Authentication: Calls the authenticate() function to obtain the access token.
* Retrieve new connections: Calls the get_new_connections() function to fetch the new connections' details.
* Generate hyper-personalized connection requests: Calls the send_connection_request() function to send the connection requests with personalized messages.

The code utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests to the LinkedIn API and the json module to handle JSON data.

-> Remember to replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', and 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI' with your actual LinkedIn API credentials in order to authenticate and make successful API requests.

-> Feel free to customize and enhance the code according to your specific requirements and LinkedIn API capabilities.
